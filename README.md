# Adds support of call-by-need parameters

At this point it's more like experimenting with scalameta rather than a real thing, although it might change at some point.


TODOs:
- [X] Initial Implementation of @WithLazy which makes all the args lazy.
- [ ] Add support for @Lazy annotated args.
- [ ] Unit testing.
